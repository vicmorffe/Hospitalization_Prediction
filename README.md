The Mexican Health and Aging Survey (MHAS) is a rich dataset that provides a unique opportunity to predict hospitalization events for adults over the age of 50. Hospitalizations can be a significant burden for the elderly, their families, and the healthcare system, and predicting the likelihood of hospitalization events can help in the early detection and prevention of adverse health outcomes.

This project aims to predict the likelihood of hospitalization events for Mexican adults over the age of 50 using data from the MHAS survey. The survey provides information on various demographic, health, and lifestyle-related factors, including age, gender, marital status, education level, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, chronic conditions, physical limitations, and mental health status.

To achieve this, the project will involve building predictive models using supervised learning techniques such as decision trees, neural networks and even experimenting with NLP models. The models will be trained on a subset of the MHAS dataset, and the performance of each model will be evaluated based on its ability to predict hospitalization events accurately.

One of the significant challenges in this project is the high dimensionality of the dataset. Therefore, a critical step in the project will be to perform dimensionality reduction techniques to identify the most significant variables contributing to hospitalization events. Once the most important variables are identified, the models will be retrained on the reduced dataset.

Once a predictive model is developed and validated, it will be deployed as a web application that allows users to input their demographic and health-related information and receive an individualized probability of hospitalization. This application will be built using Flask, a lightweight web framework, and deployed using Docker containers.

The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a tool that can help healthcare providers and individuals make informed decisions to prevent hospitalization events and improve the overall health outcomes of the elderly population.
